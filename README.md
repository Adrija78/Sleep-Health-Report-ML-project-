💤 Sleep Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project predicts daily sleep hours (SleepTime) based on lifestyle and health-related factors like workout time, reading habits, phone usage, caffeine intake, work hours, and relaxation time.
The goal is to analyze data, train ML models, and compare their performance to identify the most accurate predictor.

⚙️ Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning

Imported dataset, checked duplicates, and validated data integrity.

Feature Engineering

Selected numeric features; scaled data using MinMaxScaler.

Model Training

Applied multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

SVR (Support Vector Regression)

Decision Tree Regressor

KNN Regressor

Evaluation Metrics

MAE, RMSE, R² Score used for comparison.

📊 Key Insights

Positive Influences: More workout and relaxation time lead to better sleep.

Negative Influences: High caffeine intake, long work hours, and high screen time reduce sleep.

Model Performance: Linear Regression and SVR achieved better R² scores,providing the best predictive accuracy.

🚀 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning for SVR, Decision Tree, and KNN.

Integration of biometric data for better accuracy.

Deployment as a web or mobile app for real-time predictions.
